<p>For many first-year college students, it's the first time you're making decisions with financial independence. Balancing the burden of tuition, cost of living, and recreational spending with a limited income can be complicated.</p>
<p>Cancelling plans, deciding against buying things you want and choosing between instant noodles or sleep for dinner are some of the classic student budget tales.</p>

<p>"Students should view a budget not as a restrictive measure, but as a spending plan designed to help achieve what one wants to do and have in life," said Tanya Peterson, vice president of brand for Freedom Financial Network. "Being in control of finances allows individuals to avoid debt, prioritize, achieve goals, and lessen stress."</p>

<h1>Prioritise</h1>
<p>Sometimes you just have to sacrifice going out every now and then to save money for something more important. Yes, it's good to balance work and fun but only if it is within your means. Stay away from the impulsive purchases!
There are always going to be fun times waiting for you, but university is pretty expensive so try to finish it in as little time as you can or else you'll end up needing to cough up even more money.</p>


<h1>Take advantage of student deals</h1>
<p>Student deals are really there to help you save money so why not take advantage of it?
A lot of food and clothing stores and even certain places or events in South Africa have student discounts, so be sure to look out for them. It usually requires that you present your student card in order to qualify for the discount.
You may feel somewhat like your grandmother, but try couponing as well. No shame in being money-wise.</p>

<h1>Learn to say no</h1>
<p>Being at university, you'll find that everyone comes from different economic backgrounds. Perhaps even some of your friends are in completely different ones to your own. I'm not saying only make friends with those who are in the same economic bracket as you, but don't try to live beyond your means in order to keep up with friends.
You'll find that people are more understanding of financial issues once you reach university level, so don't have too much pride to say no when you need to. If your friends make you feel bad about it, remember that university is big and you can easily find some new less judgemental ones, yay!

<h1>Track Your Spending</h1>
<p>When building a college student budget, you'll want to start by getting a sense of the current state of your finances. Track your incoming funds and how you spend that money to better understand your habits and where your money goes.
"Your fixed expenses may be your rent, internet, gym membership. Your variable expenses may be dining out, entertainment, tuition, and school supplies," said Sandy Yong, financial speaker and author. "Understanding what you spend [your money] on is very important to determine how to tweak your budget."

<h1>Set Long-Term Financial Goals</h1>
<p>Many wealth-building strategies and long-term financial health moves have the same credo: the earlier you start, the better. As you take steps toward financial independence, it's a good idea to plan long-term goals into your college budget.
R.J. Weiss, CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER™ and founder of The Ways to Wealth, says even short-term goals can impact your long-term finances. "Your long-term goals are what should impact your short-term financial decisions," he explained. "Without goals, it's impossible to know whether you're making the right choices day to day."
You can change these goals and evolve your budget as you go, but setting aside a portion of your money toward long-term financial goals can set you up for success.

<h1>Spend Below Your Means</h1>
<p>One of the most foundational pieces of financial advice is to spend less than you earn. "Ensure you are spending below your means and have money left over at the end of each month," advised Yong. "If you are spending more than you earn, then you will need to find ways to get out of debt."
When creating your budget, make sure your total spending is less than your income. If you don't currently have an income, divide your total available funds by the length of time you expect to live off that money. For each month's allotment, do your best to spend less than you have. Overspending can fast-track you to debt, especially if that spending is mostly on credit cards.

<h1>Keep Searching for Scholarships</h1>
<p>One way to add some wiggle room to your budget is to relieve the burden of tuition. Many students stop seeking scholarships once they begin college, but you can qualify for funding throughout your whole time as a student.
According to Yong, scholarship money often goes unawarded because no one applied. "Some [scholarships] are focused on BIPOC, athletics, outstanding grades, community service, participation in student organizations — just to name a few," said Yong. "An application may take a few hours of your time, but you could reap the rewards of thousands of dollars that can help you pay off your tuition and student loans."
