</p>

</p>

<h1>Intercape</h1>

<p>If you are among those students who prefer to travel across the country by bus, either to visit your loved ones during the holiday period or to attend an important event.

</p>

<h1>Varsityvibe </h1>
<p>Varsityvibe is a web-based app designed exclusively for students on campuses around South Africa. The online platform arranges student deals with companies like Uber.
